# "Improbable Beef" Navel Bacteria Research

## Overview

A start up food company, Improbable Beef, is looking for an undiscovered species of bacteria that can help create the perfect synthetic tasting beef. This bacteria is believed to be found in the belly button. After all of the subjects were tested I put together an interactive webpage that displays the results utilizing 3 different Plotly charts. 

  - Chart 1: A horizontal bar chart that displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage.
  - Chart 2: A bubble chart that displays bacteria cultures per sample when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage.
  - Chart 3: A gauge chart that displays the weekly washing frequency's value, and displays the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
